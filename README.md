# todo-list

You are tasked to create a simple form that will be used to enter your todos details. The form will have the following fields:
todo name (text input)
todo date (date/time input or text)
todo completed (checkbox for completed or not)
Save button
On click save button, the data of the todo will appear in a div. If the todo was checked as completed, its container div will have a green background and the text will be striked.
Every time you enter a new todo, the data will be added to the div that will contain all the todos. After the todo has been added to the DOM, clear the form.
